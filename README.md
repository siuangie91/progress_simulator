# Connection Progress Simulator

_This was done as a coding exercise for an interview. The simulation base code is in `src/connectionrunner.js`_

The simulation code randomly updates a connection object so that not all connection objects finish connecting at the same time. The UI displays progress bars and a count of each type of status.
