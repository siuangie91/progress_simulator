_This was done as a coding exercise for an interview. The interviewer provided the scaffolding via `create-react-app` as well as the simulation base code in `src/connectionrunner.js`_

**Demo**: https://react-progress-simulator.onrender.com

The simulation code randomly updates a connection object so that not all connection objects finish connecting at the same time. The UI displays progress bars and a count of each type of status.
